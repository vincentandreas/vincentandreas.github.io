## Point Of Sales (POS) Application based on Node.js and Flutter

A few months ago, we were making apps for stock inventory and record the purchase. The client needed mobile apps based. 

We develop some feature, such as: 

1. Stock inventory / Move Product feature
   To monitoring product stock, from Warehouse to another Warehouse, or Warehouse to Store, and vice versa.
2. Create Purchase feature
   To record purchase.
3. Financial Report feature
   To show the sales report, from each Store, daily, monthly, or yearly. 
   
   
Technology:

1. Backend-side :
   For the backend technology, we using Express.js, with MySql database. To make sure the backend-apps run correctly, we also making end-to-end test using Mocha. 
2. Mobile apps-side :
   We use flutter, with BLoC pattern, to make more convinient and responseful state-change.
